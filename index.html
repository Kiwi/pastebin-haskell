<h3>Paste server for <code>#haskell</code></h3>

<p>
Help us help you: put in your code along with a brief description about what you are trying to do and how it failed (such as error messages).
For installation and project management questions, include stack.yaml, *.cabal, cabal.project files (if you have any of those, of course).
If you have 5 minutes to spare, please enjoy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">this classic read</a> first; while it is about bug reports, asking good questions is a quite similar process.
